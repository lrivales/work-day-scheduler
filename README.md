# Work Day Scheduler

This is the module 5 assigment for the GW Coding Bootcamp Course submitted by Lawrence Rivales.

This is a basic work day scheduler app.  It can be reached at https://lrivales.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Usage

The cells are color-coded:
    Gray - the row is in the past of current time.
    Red - the row is within the hour of current time.
    Green - the row is in the future of current time.
The scope of the scheduler is only for a typical workday (9AM - 5PM).
Click anywhere inside a cell in the middle column and type your task/event.
Click the Save button on the right for the corresponding row.
If you refresh page or relaunch the browser, your previously saved tasks/events will be displayed.
Click the Save button again if you want to keep your previsouly saved tasks.
